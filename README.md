# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2023 - 2024

## Description

I made an one page website, with two sections, about which four countries are the besta and most recent I have been to. The other section is about the country I want to go to the most. 
These two sections snap when you scroll, and when you enter the last section, you can see some beautifull scroll animtions.

This assignment was more focused on Javascript and API's. Almost all the data you see on the page is loaded dynamiclly out of a json file and a weather api.

<!-- How about a section that describes how to install this project? ðŸ¤“ -->

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/JopMolenaar/web-app-from-scratch-2324.git
```

2. Open the cloned file with your code editor and start coding!

### If you want the backend too

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd web-app-from-scratch-2324
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

- The page that is partially generated with ejs and backend, will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/backendPage`.
- The index.html page that is now hosted with the localhost, will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

<!-- ...but how does one use this project? What are its features ðŸ¤” -->

## Use of features

<!-- What external data source is featured in your project and what are its properties ðŸŒ  -->

## External data source properties

The external data source that I use is the api from visualcrossing.com.
I use this api to get the current temperature of the countries that I have visited. 
You need an api key for this api, and you will get one when you make an account. 

The api query that I use is:
```
https://weather.visualcrossing.com/VisualCrossingWebServices/rest/services/timelinemulti?key=${apiKey}&locations=${encodedCityList}
```

The encodedCityList looks like: `London%2CUK%7CParis%2CFrance%7CTokyo%2CJapan%7CCape%20Town%2C%20South%20Africa`, but is made like this in the js.

The response consists out of four countries, with the current weathercondition and the upcoming 7 days weatherconditions.
